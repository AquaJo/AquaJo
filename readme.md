Hi, I am a german programmer, 

currently I am into electron desktop app programming, building an app named hueFL, which is controlling hue lights through a GUI including features like background sync and music sync (powered over Java calls because of its speed).

Frontend side I Really like javascript programming,
when it comes to backend I like Node.js serverside programming, 

but I also enjoy Java (--> see my project: "image manipulator") and am looking forward to learn new languages and get to know more and more awesome apis.
